# Celebrate Pi with Boca Code

Using the [Nilakantha's formula for pi](http://www.maeckes.nl/Formule%20voor%20pi%20(Nilakantha)%20GB.html) we try to calculate pi using React.

Oh sure. You could do it manually but do you have 1000 years? I certainly DON'T 

Happy Pi day from your friends at [Boca Code Coding BootCamp](https://bocacode.com)
